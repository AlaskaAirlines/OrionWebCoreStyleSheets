# Orion Web Core Style Sheets

The core front-end framework for building experiences with the Orion Design System.

Orion Web Core Style sheets is a responsive, mobile-first collection of styles and tools designed to make it quick and simple for developers to create web experiences using the Orion Design Language.

## What's included

This repository is a library of core level styles, functions, and mixins that can be used for consistent front-end UI development.

## Current support

The current version of Orion Web Core Style Sheets supports:

1. `AS Circular` web font, font file resources and `@font-face` Sass -- [Install Instructions](https://github.com/AlaskaAirlines/OrionWebCoreStyleSheets/blob/master/docs/howToUseFonts.md)
1. Orion defined breakpoint mixins
1. CSS Normalize
1. Orion baseline styles
1. Orion baselineLTE styles
1. Utility (functional) CSS classes
1. Experimental \<input /> styling

### Importing utility classes and using the !important flag

When using the Utility Classes, there are two ways to include them. Either subscribe to each family of functional selectors individually, or include all families in a single request.

```scss
// import all functional selectors
@import "./node_modules/@alaskaairux/orion-web-core-style-sheets/utilityClasses";

or ...

// impoorting individual selector families
@import "./node_modules/@alaskaairux/orion-web-core-style-sheets/utilityClasses/displayProperties";
@import "./node_modules/@alaskaairux/orion-web-core-style-sheets/utilityClasses/responsive";
```

In the event that the `!important` flag is needed for the functional selectors, simply define this variable prior to importing the Utility Class files.

```scss
// import all functional selectors
$important: !important;
@import "./node_modules/@alaskaairux/orion-web-core-style-sheets/utilityClasses";

or ...

// impoorting individual selector families
$important: !important;
@import "./node_modules/@alaskaairux/orion-web-core-style-sheets/utilityClasses/displayProperties";
@import "./node_modules/@alaskaairux/orion-web-core-style-sheets/utilityClasses/responsive";
```


## Peer Dependencies

Orion Web Core Style Sheets has a project peer dependency on [Orion Design Tokens](https://github.com/AlaskaAirlines/OrionDesignTokens), as well as Sass and Style Dictionary. Orion Web Core Style Sheets is not a stand alone project, but is part of a specific dependency chain when building Orion based applications.

## Dependencies

When using OWCSS, there is a direct dependency on the `focus-visible` library. When using Orion Web Components, the inclusion of the `focus-visible` library is accounted for within the scope fo the component(s). With components, `focus-visible` is defined as a peer dependency.

If the use of OWCSS is not specifically with a component, including the `focus-visible.min.js` file will be required within the scope of the project. For example, the JS may be added to the head of a project:

```html
<script src="/node_modules/focus-visible/dist/focus-visible.min.js"></script>
```

or to the scope of any Node.js component architecture:

```javascript
import 'focus-visible/dist/focus-visible.min.js';
```

The `focus-visable` library is required for use with experimental a11y UI features

## Accessibility

Use of the the `focus-visible` library brings in the capability to be selective with the UI between clicking/tapping into a control versus tabbing to a control. In most cases, the a11y halo will only appear when a control is tabbed to. But in cases where there is a \<input /> element that supports text and/or triggers a virtual keyboard if a physical keyboard is not present, the focus-visible state will be triggered.

[Selectors Level 4 draft: 9.4. The Focus-Indicated Pseudo-class: :focus-visible](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-focus-visible-pseudo)

CSS to support this capability is within the `_baseline.scss` and `_baselineLTE.scss` files.

### Experimental styles

To help address the UI of \<input /> elements, there is an experimental style sheet located in the npm. Please refer to the documentation in this code for any information related to it's use.

```scss
@alaskaairux/orion-web-core-style-sheets/formElements/inputTypeText
```

DO NOT include Sass file without a parent wrapper as illustrated below:

```scss
.[parent-selector] {
  @import "./node_modules/@alaskaairux/orion-web-core-style-sheets/formElements/inputTypeText";
}
```

The use of the parent selector is to define a custom selector that will wrap these experimental input style as not to pollute the rest of the app's CSS.

## Getting started

All resources within this repository are distributed via npm and used as individual dependencies. Each resource can be called into your Sass pipeline within a `global.scss` file or individually referenced within UI components.

## Sass support

Orion Web Core Style Sheets consists of resources to be ingested a la carte. For example, you wish to use `breakpoints.scss` on an individual component or bring into a global Sass catch-all file, you would use the following example.

```
@import "@alaskaairux/orion-web-core-style-sheets/breakpoints";
```

## CSS writing conventions

The implementation of Orion Web Code Style Sheets uses a naming convention model that will be strictly adhered to throughout this library and compliance is expected for any contributed updates.

To learn more, please reference [this document](https://github.com/AlaskaAirlines/OrionWebCoreStyleSheets/blob/master/docs/cssConventions.md).

## Tests

Prior to adding new Sass to this repo, please run the Sass-Lint tests to ensure that any new code is compliant with the set-forward standard. To run the tests, run the following command:

```
$ npm run sassLint
```

If there is an error, this will generate a `.html` file at the root of the project. To view this generated file, run the following command:

```
$ open sass-lint.html
```

This should open the file in your default browser.

This file is ignored and will not be added to the version control.
