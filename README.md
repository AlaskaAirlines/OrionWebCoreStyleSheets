The core front-end framework for building experiences with the  Design System.

WC Style sheets is a responsive, mobile-first collection of styles and tools designed to make it quick and simple for developers to create web experiences using the Orion Design Language and assist with transition to the Auro Design Language.

## What's included

This repository is a library of core level styles, functions, and mixins that can be used for consistent front-end UI development. This will include full descriptions of CSS selectors, mixins and any other supporting functions or tools. 

## All styles documented 

Please see the [documentation site](https://alaskaairlines.github.io/OrionWebCoreStyleSheets/) for all information related to WC Style Sheets. 

## †Deprecated

With each release of WC Style Sheets please be sure to pay attention to the †DEPRECATED section of the doc site. All styles that are designated as deprecated will be listed in this section and will be deleted with the next major release. Each deprecated item may list an alternative option. If there is not an alternative option, please consult with your team designer for an alternate solution. 

#### Deprecated files

| deprecated file | new file | description |
|---|---|---|
| baselineLTE.scss | core.scss | File deprecation to support new features |
| baseline.scss | essentials.scss | `essentials.scss` does not import headings by default. For new Auro heading sselectors import `headings.scss`. These new selectors support scoping and prefixing. 
| inputTypeText.scss | n/a | n/a |
| _layoutProperties.scss | see `_insetUtility.scss` `_layoutPropertiesGenerator.scss` and `_spacingUtility.scss` | The legacy layoutProperties file was broken up into separate concerns |


## Support 

If at any time there is an issue discovered by either the document site or the core library itself, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/AlaskaAirlines/OrionWebCoreStyleSheets/issues/new/choose) as to alert the core team of the situation. We appreciate all your support! 

## Install

OWCSS is made up of a series of Sass files that allows for an array of use cases. There is no core file to import, rather WCSS is an à la carte solution allowing for users to import what they want and when they want it. In most cases you can simply import the Sass file as illustrated below: 

```scss
@import "~@alaskaairux/orion-web-core-style-sheets/dist/ ... "
```

### Scoping

Be sure to see the [prefixing and scoping API](http://alaskaairlines.github.io/OrionWebCoreStyleSheets/#scope-prefix) in the documentation site. 

When supporting legacy UIs there may be issues with importing a Sass file and its selectors. To enable scoping simply set the `$scope` variable to be `true` prior to importing any selectors that support this setting. 

```scss
$scope: true;
@import "~@alaskaairux/orion-web-core-style-sheets/dist/ ... "
```

This setting will result in the following CSS selectors

```css
html.auro { ... }

.auro body,
.auro .baseType { ... }
```

### Prefixing

To enable prefixing simply set the `$prefix` variable to be `true` prior to importing any selectors that support this setting. 

```scss
$prefix: true;
@import "~@alaskaairux/orion-web-core-style-sheets/dist/ ... "
```

This setting will result in the following CSS selectors

```css
html { ... }

body,
.auro_baseType { ... }
```

### Scoping and prefixing

If needed, both `$scope` and `prefix` can work in tandem. To enable, simply set both the `scope` and `prefix` variables as `true` prior to importing any selectors that support these settings. 

```scss
$scope: true;
$prefix: true;
@import "~@alaskaairux/orion-web-core-style-sheets/dist/ ... "
``` 

This setting will result in the following CSS selectors

```css
html.auro { ... }

.auro body,
.auro .auro_baseType { ... }
```

### Importing utility classes and using the !important flag

When using the Utility Classes, there are two ways to include them. Either subscribe to each family of functional selectors individually, or include all families in a single request.

See [API](http://alaskaairlines.github.io/OrionWebCoreStyleSheets/#utility-variable-important)


### layoutPropertiesGenerator

Importing this file will auto-generates all available utility selectors. Output can be configured by redefining default values prior to import. See default value examples below.

```sass
none, xs, md, lg, xl
```

See [API](http://alaskaairlines.github.io/OrionWebCoreStyleSheets/#utility-layout-mixin-auro_layoutPropertiesGenerator)

### insetUtility selector generator

Importing this file will return a series of pre-defined inset (_the padding around an element where all sides are equal_) selectors based on the inset spacing design spec.

```sass
none, xxxs, xxs, xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl, xxxl
```

See [API](http://alaskaairlines.github.io/OrionWebCoreStyleSheets/#utility-layout-mixin-auro_inset)

### spacingUtility selector generator

Importing this file will return a series of pre-defined selectors based on the stack or inline spacing design specs

```sass
[inline, stack] inline - L/R, stack - top/bottom

none, xxxs, xxs, xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl, xxxl
```2

See [API](http://alaskaairlines.github.io/OrionWebCoreStyleSheets/#utility-layout-mixin-auro_spacing)

## CSS writing conventions

The implementation of WCSS uses a naming convention model that will be strictly adhered to throughout this library and compliance is expected for any contributed updates.

### Utility

Universally applicable selectors in cases where applying this style is not an appropriate responsibility of another selector. These selectors are typically considered UI trump cards as they may use the `!important` flag. 

To learn more about how the `!important` flag can be used with WCSS, please [see the api spec](https://alaskaairlines.github.io/OrionWebCoreStyleSheets/#variable-important).

(may define shape or layout without direct context to any element, component or object)

```css
.util_hidden {
  display: none;
}

.util_hiddenVisually {
  border: 0;
  clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  padding: 0;
  position: absolute;
  width: 1px;
}
```

### Auro supporting styles

Auro web component styles are a special class of utility selectors where common UIs that are mainly addressed in Auro web components are needed in situations where web components cannot be used.

These selectors will be visible by the `.auro_` prefix in the selector name, for example; 


```css
.auro_roleButton { ... }

.auro_hyperlink { ... }
```

**NOTE:** The `auro_` prefix will be appended to an Auro supporting selector regardless of the `$prefix` flag setting. Also, the `auro_` prefix will not be duplicated if the `$prefix` flag is set `true`.

### Additional documentation 

To learn more about Auro standards in CSS selector conventions, please see [this document](https://github.com/AlaskaAirlines/OrionWebCoreStyleSheets/blob/master/staticDocs/cssConventions.md).


## Dependencies

When using WCSS, there is a direct dependency on the `focus-visible` library. When using Web Components, the inclusion of the `focus-visible` library is accounted for within the scope fo the component(s). With components, `focus-visible` is defined as a peer dependency.

If the use of WCSS is not specifically with a component, including the `focus-visible.min.js` file will be required within the scope of the project. For example, the JS may be added to the head of a project:

```html
<script src="/node_modules/focus-visible/dist/focus-visible.min.js"></script>
```

or to the scope of any Node.js component architecture:

```javascript
import 'focus-visible/dist/focus-visible.min.js';
```

The `focus-visable` library is required for use with experimental a11y UI features

## Accessibility

Use of the the `focus-visible` library brings in the capability to be selective with the UI between clicking/tapping into a control versus tabbing to a control. In most cases, the a11y halo will only appear when a control is tabbed to. But in cases where there is a `<input />` element that supports text and/or triggers a virtual keyboard if a physical keyboard is not present, the `focus-visible` state will be triggered.

[Selectors Level 4 draft: 9.4. The Focus-Indicated Pseudo-class: :focus-visible](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-focus-visible-pseudo)

## Getting started

All resources within this repository are distributed via npm and used as individual dependencies. Each resource can be called into your Sass pipeline within a `global.scss` file or individually referenced within UI components.

## Linters

Sass-Lint tests to ensure that any new code is compliant with the set-forward standard. Sass-Lint is run as a pre-commit hook in this project. No commits will be allowed unless all linter tests are passed. 

If there is an error, this will generate a `.html` file at the root of the project. To view this generated file, run the following command:

```
$ open sass-lint.html
```

This should open the file in your default browser.

This file is ignored and will not be added to the version control.

## Development 

To develop against WCSS run both `npm run watch` and `npm run serve` in separate terminals. 

The `watch` command will run a Sass linter, process a test file from Sass to CSS and run a post CSS linter. This will ensure the quality of all new Sass added to the repo. 

If additional selectors or scenarios are needed, please update the `./scripts/testBuild.scss` file to test your code. 

Running the `serve` command will open the Sassdoc view. Please review all changes as Sassdoc produces all documentation.
